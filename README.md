# Global Infant Mortality Rates - Public Data Repository
This repository was created for Professor Gotzler's English 105 course during the Spring 2024 semester at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

## Contents
This repository contains a Python notebook called `FeederFinal.ipynb` that was created using [Google Colab](https://colab.google/).
* The notebook itself provides instructions on how to condense the raw data into a smaller, more organized data subset.
* This `.ipynb` file allows users to follow along and create their own subset of the original, raw data.

The data folder of this repository consists of three `.csv` files: `Infant Mortality Rates 1 - Infant Mortality Rates 1.csv`, `Infant Mortality Rates 2.csv`, and `final_subset.csv`.
* Both `Infant Mortality Rates 1 - Infant Mortality Rates 1.csv` and `Infant Mortality Rates 2.csv` were acquired through [The World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.IMRT.IN).
* The `final_subset.csv` was created according to the instructions detailed in the `FeederFinal.ipynb`. This `.csv` contains a subset of the previous `.csv` files' data, including the infant mortality rates associated with countries in varying regions of the world for comparison between the years 1960 and 2021.

## Purpose 
* The purpose of this data repository is to allow users to compare past global infant mortality rates to present global infant mortality rates.
* This data might be useful for sociologists or public health research scientists who wish to analyze global patterns in terms of infant mortality rates. In particular, these professionals can determine how global events have affected and continue to affect these patterns.
